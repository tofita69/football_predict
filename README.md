This project explores the effectiveness of various time series forecasting models for predicting goal differences in English Premier League football matches. By leveraging historical match data and relevant features, we aim to provide insights into potential match outcomes.

Getting Started

Clone the repository:
Bash

git clone https://github.com/your_username/football-match-goal-difference-prediction.git
Install dependencies:
Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(Optional) Download and prepare your data. You'll need historical football match data with relevant features. Specific instructions on data preparation will be added in the future.

Run the analysis:

The project is currently structured as a set of Python scripts. Specific instructions on running the analysis scripts will be added in the future.

Future Work

This project is ongoing, and several avenues for future exploration exist:

Feature engineering: Exploring additional features like player statistics, team form indicators, or external factors (weather) could improve model accuracy.
Hyperparameter tuning: More extensive tuning of the models could lead to better performance.
Model ensembling: Combining predictions from multiple models could further enhance accuracy.
Advanced Transformer architectures: Exploring more advanced Transformer variants might yield improvements.
Error analysis: A deeper analysis of prediction errors could guide future development.
Data Augmentation: Techniques to artificially increase the size and diversity of the training data could benefit complex models like Transformers.
